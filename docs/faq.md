> Start from [Installation Guide](Installation) for first deployment, then use this page for edge cases.

## Installation

**Q: Do I need to root my tablet?**
- **A:** No! FreeKiosk uses Android's official Device Owner API. **No root required**.

**Q: Do I need Android Studio?**
- **A:** No! Just ADB tool (15 MB download). See [Installation Guide](Installation).

**Q: Can I install from Play Store?**
- **A:** Yes! Search "FreeKiosk" on Google Play Store, or download APK from [Releases](https://github.com/rushb-fr/freekiosk/releases).

**Q: Which Android versions are supported?**
- **A:** Android 8.0+ (API 26 and above).

## Device Owner

**Q: What is Device Owner mode?**
- **A:** Device Owner is Android's official enterprise feature that gives FreeKiosk complete control over the device for full kiosk lockdown. It's like MDM (Mobile Device Management) but built into Android.

**Q: Is Device Owner required?**
- **A:** No, but **highly recommended** for production use. Without Device Owner, kiosk lockdown is partial (users may exit with back button, see notifications, etc.).

**Q: Can I activate Device Owner after installing FreeKiosk?**
- **A:** Yes! You just need to remove **all accounts** from the device first (Settings → Accounts). Once the `dpm` command succeeds, you can sign back into your accounts. A factory reset is **not** required — only the absence of active accounts matters.

**Q: Factory reset required?**
- **A:** No! Android's actual requirement is that **no user accounts** are active on the device. Simply remove all accounts (Google, Samsung, Microsoft, SIM profiles), run the `dpm` command, then sign back in. A factory reset is only needed as a fallback if account removal alone doesn't work (some devices retain hidden accounts).

**Q: Can I remove Device Owner?**
- **A:** Yes! In FreeKiosk settings, use the "⚠️ Remove Device Owner" button (NOT "Exit Kiosk Mode"). Or via ADB:
  ```bash
  adb shell dpm remove-active-admin com.freekiosk/.DeviceAdminReceiver
  ```

**Q: Does Device Owner void warranty?**
- **A:** No. Device Owner is an official Android feature with no system modifications.

## Usage

**Q: How to access settings in kiosk mode?**
- **A:** Tap 5 times on the secret button (default: bottom-right corner), then enter your PIN code.

**Q: Can I use custom URLs?**
- **A:** Yes! Any HTTPS/HTTP URL works (Home Assistant, dashboards, websites, web apps, etc.).

**Q: Does it work with Home Assistant?**
- **A:** Perfectly! Many users deploy FreeKiosk for Home Assistant dashboards.

**Q: Can I display local HTML files?**
- **A:** Currently only HTTP/HTTPS URLs. Local file support coming in v1.1.

**Q: How do I change the URL?**
- **A:** Tap 5 times bottom-right → Enter PIN → Settings → Change URL.

**Q: I forgot my PIN code. What do I do?**
- **A:** If Device Owner is active: You'll need to factory reset (or use ADB to remove Device Owner first). This is by design for security.

**Q: Can I rotate between multiple URLs?**
- **A:** Not yet, but planned for v1.1! You can use a single URL pointing to a page that rotates content.

## Compatibility

**Q: Which tablets are supported?**
- **A:** Any Android 8.0+ tablet. Tested on:
  | Brand | Models |
  |---|---|
  | **Samsung** | Galaxy Tab A8, A9+, S6 Lite |
  | **Lenovo** | Tab M10, M11 |
  | **Xiaomi** | Redmi Pad SE |
  | **Generic** | Most Android tablets |

**Q: Does it work on Samsung tablets?**
- **A:** Yes! Device Owner mode specifically blocks Samsung update popups and bloatware.

**Q: Does it work on Fire tablets (Amazon)?**
- **A:** Should work, but not officially tested. Device Owner setup may differ on Fire OS.

**Q: Does it work on smartphones?**
- **A:** Technically yes, but FreeKiosk is optimized for tablets. Phone screens are small for kiosk displays.

**Q: Does it work on Chromebooks?**
- **A:** No. FreeKiosk is Android-only.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Kiosk mode doesn't lock completely**
- **A:** Make sure Device Owner is activated. Without Device Owner, lockdown is partial. See [Installation Guide](installation.md#advanced-install-device-owner-mode).

**Q: System notifications still appear**
- **A:** Device Owner mode blocks all notifications. If they still appear:
  1. Verify Device Owner is active: `adb shell dpm list-owners`
  2. Reboot tablet
  3. Restart kiosk mode

**Q: Samsung update popup appears**
- **A:** Device Owner mode should block Samsung popups. If they still appear, try:
  1. Suspend Samsung system apps in FreeKiosk settings (coming in v1.1)
  2. Verify Device Owner: `adb shell dpm list-owners`

**Q: WebView doesn't load my URL**
- **Causes:**
  - URL is not HTTPS/HTTP
  - No internet connection
  - Self-signed SSL certificate (not trusted)
- **Solutions:**
  - Use valid HTTPS URL
  - Check WiFi connection
  - Use trusted SSL certificate

**Q: App crashes on start**
- **A:** Please report a bug with:
  - Device model
  - Android version
  - Crash logs (if possible)

**Q: FreeKiosk doesn't auto-start after hard restart**
- **A:** A hard restart (holding power + volume buttons for 10s) may reset the app to initial state. Make sure "Launch on Boot" is enabled in Settings → Security tab. Starting from v1.3.0, the app checks the stored setting before launching, ensuring consistent behavior.

**Q: Power button doesn't work in kiosk mode**
- **A:** By default, Lock Mode blocks all system features including the power menu. Starting from v1.3.0, you can enable "Allow Power Button" in Settings → Security tab → Lock Mode section. This allows shutting down the device without exiting kiosk mode.

**Q: Are my settings preserved after updating FreeKiosk?**
- **A:** **Yes!** All your settings (URL, PIN, display mode, etc.) are stored locally on your device and are preserved when updating FreeKiosk. You don't need to reconfigure anything after an update.

## Dashboard Mode

**Q: What is Dashboard Mode?**
- **A:** Dashboard Mode replaces the single-URL WebView with a grid of configurable URL tiles. Each tile has a name and a URL — tap it to open the page. A navigation bar lets you go back, forward, refresh, or return to the grid.

**Q: How do I enable Dashboard Mode?**
- **A:** Go to Settings → Dashboard tab → toggle "Dashboard Mode" on. Then add your tiles with a name and URL for each.

**Q: Can I use Dashboard Mode with Inactivity Return?**
- **A:** Yes! Enable "Inactivity Return" in Settings → General. After the configured timeout without touch, the app automatically returns to the dashboard grid.

**Q: What happens with the URL Planner in Dashboard Mode?**
- **A:** Scheduled planner events take priority — they switch from the grid to the scheduled URL. When the event ends, the app returns to the dashboard grid automatically.

**Q: How many tiles can I create?**
- **A:** There is no hard limit. The grid adapts to the number of tiles.

## Features

**Q: Can I customize the PIN length?**
- **A:** Not yet, but planned. Current: 4-6 digits.

**Q: Can I hide the "Exit Kiosk Mode" button?**
- **A:** Not yet, but planned for v1.1 (configurable in settings).

**Q: Can I schedule kiosk mode on/off?**
- **A:** Not yet, planned for v1.2.

**Q: Does FreeKiosk collect data?**
- **A:** **No!** FreeKiosk is 100% offline. No analytics, no tracking, no data collection. Your privacy is respected.

**Q: Can I use FreeKiosk offline?**
- **A:** Yes! Once configured, FreeKiosk works offline (your URL must be accessible offline too).
